# 3bitFullAdder-ECE273
## Summary
The purpose of this lab was to design a 3 bit full adder using two's compliment. <br> <br>
The design was made using **Xylinx software along with PlanAhead** and implemented on a **BASYS2 FPGA Board** <br> <br>
**Files available are:**<br>
  1) Pdf report that contains all of the below along with procedure <br>
  2) Module to show architectural behavior or full adder (FA) <br>
  3) PlanAhead Generated Physical constraints <br>
  4) Test bench code to test a few sample example <br>
  5) Main binary file(.bit) that is then flashed onto board for Demo <br>
  6) Pictures of the main schematic and waveforms <br> <br>
  _Note that all labs are required to have an example test bench and waveforms to display theoretical sucess along with a demo to demonstrate actaul success_
